      <h2>About this app</h2>
      <p>Include information here about your app.</p>
      <h3>Instructions for using the app</h3>
      <h4>Two key switch</h4>
      <p>
        The two keys used for this use are: <b>a</b> and <b>s</b>. So the user
        can press the 'a' key to select the next key/button in the calculator,
        and when they want to select/click the key, the need to use the 's'
        bar/key. Using 'a' key will start from the top left button, that is 7,
        and continue going right until it reach the bottom right button,
        minus(-), and will go back to the top left one again, completing the
        loop. At any point of the focusing of the buttons, the user can press
        's' to select/click the focused button(identified by the yellow color).
      </p>

      <h4>One key switch</h4>
      <p>
        The one key used for this one is: <b><i>z</i></b
        >.<br />
        So to use this key, user needs to press the 'z' key once, and the focus
        loop will start from the top left corner, which is 7. Then will will
        continue to go to the next button after each 1000 ms. To stop the loop
        and select/click a button, the user has to press 'z' again, that will
        first stop the loop, then within 1000 ms, the user has to press 'z'
        again to actually get the value. After 1000 ms, pressing the 'z' key
        will start the loop from where it stopped.
        <i
          >It is mandatory to press the 'z' key within 1000 ms after stopping
          the loop to be able to click the button. </i
        >So the overall process is like this: <br />
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Press 'z' to start the focus selection loop. It will continue to focus
          on each key with 1000 ms interval
        </li>
        <li>Press 'z' again to stop the focus loop</li>
        <li>
          If the desired button is in focus, press 'z' again within 1000ms to
          "Click" the button
        </li>
        <li>
          If this is not the intended button, wait 1000ms, then press 'z' again
          to start the focus loop from that button.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat step 2 to use the calculator</li>
        <li>
          To exit the loop/one switch mode, press 'x', or stop after step 2
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Test results</h3>
      <p>
        I tested several equations and calculations using both two key and one
        key switch. In all cases, two key was faster, as I was able to click the
        buttons faster. But the one key switch was more convenient, as I did not
        have to move my hand on the keyboard. However, the one key switch was
        not as fast as the two key switch. I tried to reduce the interval, but
        in that case it was hard to click the button, as the focus was changing
        too fast. So I kept the interval at 1000ms.

				Also, when entering/clicking same number multiple times, the one key switch gave
				a really hard time. It was not possible to click the same button twice, as the 
				time interval was not enough. So I had to wait till next loop to click the same
				button again. But in two key switch, I could click the same button multiple times.
      </p>

      <h3>Anything else you have tried out</h3>
      <p>
        I tried to implement the one switch in a way that after pressing 'z' to
        stop the loop, if the user didn't press 'z' again to click the button,
        the loop would auto start again after 1000ms. But I was not able to do
        that.
